This document does not aim to justify the deisgn decisions made, only list the conventions used in this project any added code must comply with. Any non compliant code must justify its use; not the other way around.

1: prefer std::unique_ptr, then shared_ptr; only use raw pointers for non owning pointers
2: member variables prefixed with m_
3: lower_case_underscore for naming classes/functions/variables (complying with stl naming conventions)
4: prefer not annotating types in header files and minimalize in cpp files to keep types more
